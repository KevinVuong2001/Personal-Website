        `For my senior capstone, I collaborated with eight colleagues to develop WonderTix, an open-source software project sponsored by Portland Playhouse and initiated at Portland State University in 2021. 
        WonderTix is a comprehensive sales platform designed to manage task assignments, generate financial reports, and handle ticket sales. 
        At the start of the project, the financial reports relied on hardcoded data, which limited flexibility for future updates. 
        To address this, I developed a Restful API endpoint to deliver critical financial information dynamically. 
        I also created a Sales Overview Report leveraging the new API, implemented in React and TypeScript which served as a blueprint for integrating additional reports through a scalable backend approach.`,
