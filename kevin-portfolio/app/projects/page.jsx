        `For my senior capstone, I collaborated with eight colleagues to develop WonderTix, an open-source software project sponsored by Portland Playhouse and initiated at Portland State University in 2021. 
        WonderTix is a comprehensive sales platform designed to manage task assignments, generate financial reports, and handle ticket sales. 
        In my role, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development. 
        At the start of the project, the financial reports relied on hardcoded data, which limited flexibility for future updates. 
        To address this, I developed a Restful API endpoint to deliver critical financial information dynamically. 
        I also created a Sales Overview Report leveraging the new API, which served as a blueprint for integrating additional reports through a scalable backend approach.`,
